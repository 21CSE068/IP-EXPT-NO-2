<p style="text align: left;">New Zealand’s cultural influences are predominantly European and Māori.Immigrant groups have generally tended to assimilate into the European lifestyle, although traditional customs are still followed by many Tongans, Samoans, and other Pacific peoples. Māori culture suffered greatly in the years of colonization and into the 20th century, and many Māori were torn between the pressure to assimilate and the desire to preserve their own culture.However,since the 1950s there has been a cultural renaissance, with a determined effort to preserve and revive artistic and social traditions.The culture of the Pākehā (the Māori term for those of European descent) has come to incorporate many aspects of Māori culture.The biennial Te Matatini festival,first held in 1972, celebrates Māori culture, especially the traditional dance and song performances known as kapa haka.The festival is held over several days, each time in a different region of New Zealand, and culminates in the national kapa haka championship.New Zealanders generally see themselves as being open-minded towards new ideas, difference and change. Most Kiwis are proud of their country’s historically prevailing liberal social attitudes (for example, New Zealand was the first country in the world to give women the right to vote). Largely, New Zealanders try to be accepting and tolerant of most differences. Society is underpinned by strong egalitarian beliefs that everyone should have the equal opportunity to better their circumstances regardless of their background. People who are financially successful are not viewed as being better than anyone else – rather, those who are privileged are simply acknowledged as better off than others. As such, whilst there are social stratifications among the wealthy, the middle-income earners and the poor, there is no formal class structure in society. A person’s level of education and wealth does not necessarily earn them status or respect; instead it is simply acknowledged that they have an advantage or a ‘leg up in life’. Thus, people from different social brackets tend to interact quite easily.

<h2 style="color:#7D1B13;">♦Māori culture♦</h2>
Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand.Māori culture is a very central part of life here and this includes Māori food,language,and customs.Even if you're just living here for a short time,it's important that you know,understand and respect Māori customs and how to interact in Māori culture.Māori have been the tangata whenua (indigenous people) of Aotearoa (New Zealand) for a millennia. Their ancestors migrated from the Polynesian region of Hawaiki over 1,000 years ago. British settlers began arriving in the 18th century, and eventually claimed the territory as an official colony of the Crown. In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed to establish and guide the relationship between the Crown in New Zealand and Māori. However, the process of colonisation caused widespread violence and dispossessed many Māori of their land, fracturing and marginalising communities and cultural identities.
